👋 Hi there! I'm @sbonnard, a French web developer based in beautiful Normandy.

💻 Passionate about all things web, I’m also a guitar enthusiast 🎸 with a love for blues 🎶, tabletop RPGs 🎲, and video games 🎮.

🍺 Before diving into web development, I worked as an alcohol merchant, specializing in beer, wine, rum, whiskey, cognac, and champagne. Spirits and fine drinks remain a true passion of mine!
